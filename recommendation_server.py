"""Minimal recommendation service (stand-in for the OTel demo's Python service).

Fixed revision (bounded recent-id cache). Two things matter here:

1. **It is a real, runnable service.** `python recommendation_server.py` starts an
   HTTP server on :8080 AND a background load thread that keeps calling
   `get_recommendations`. So when this image runs in a container, its working-set
   memory climbs monotonically on its own — 故障诊断处置 Agent can OBSERVE a live leaking
   process (`docker stats`, the /metrics endpoint), not merely infer it from text.

2. **The recent-id cache is bounded in pure logic that pytest can pin down.**
   `get_recommendations` records requested ids into a module-level
   `deque(maxlen=SEEN_IDS_MAXLEN)`, so the tracking structure — and with it the
   working set — stays flat under sustained load instead of growing until OOM.
   `test_memory_is_bounded` is the build+test gate that guards this.

Kept dependency-light (stdlib only, no gRPC/framework) so 代码修复 Agent can build+test it
with just the stdlib + pytest in the clone, and so the container image stays tiny.
